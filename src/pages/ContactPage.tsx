        Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I am a cinema costume breakdown
        artist specializing in the art of aging and dyeing. As a breakdown
        artist, I meticulously recreate the effects of nature, use, time, and
        temperature on the layers of textiles and materials, producing authentic
        textures and special effects that bring costumes in film and TV series
        to life.
